        It all began in the distant year of 2014 with a small dream of starting my own software development company. The vision was to create highly professional products, considering the financial capabilities of the client's business. I had a small team of 4 people to whom I delegated my projects and freelance orders, but it wasn't what I dreamed of. I firmly decided that I needed to grow professionally.

        I quit my full-time job and started dedicating all my time to the development of my business. Gradually, day by day, through numerous sleepless nights, I began to achieve what I had dreamed of â€“ the first significant project, the first professionals with over 8 years of experience in the team, the first leap towards the dream. Today, thanks to perseverance and knowledge, the Marrix Power team comprises 30+ employees, each with more than 8 years of experience. We have developed 200+ projects, and a substantial portion of them are million-dollar applications. We have vast commercial experience, we are professionals, but we always remain customer-oriented.
